# A Troubled Double

Originally a game jam submission, A Troubled Double is a Crash Bandicoot: Twinsanity inspired puzzle platformer that puts you in control of a wanted delinquent and her partner-in-mischief brother. Throw your brother around the level to get rid of police drones with his trusty slingshot and push buttons to move parts of the level around, granting you both a path of escape. The catch? You can't leave him behind.
