# **NYC-based Gameplay Programmer & Computer Science Student**

<img style="float: left; padding-right:20px" src="/assets/barwani.webp">

I'm a Gameplay Programmer working towards a degree at NYU's College of Arts and Sciences working towards a B.A in Computer Science and Linguistics. 

In 2019 I co-founded an indie game development studio called Nahar Studios: [nahar.dev](https://nahar.dev/). I mainly work as a team lead, gameplay programmer, and game/level designer, communicating with artists, writers, and designers on design, implementation, and cohesion. Most of my work revolves around developing core gameplay systems (AI and Player systems, UX/UI, level design object implementations, as well as general gameplay and workflow systems - inheritance and composition structures, state machines, singletons, asset integration, etc.)

I am a lab member of NYU's [OSIRIS Offensive Cybersecurity Lab](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/), where I take part in CTF challenge solving and writing as a way to hone my programming skills. I mainly focus on cryptography and reverse engineering challenges and my writeups for those are available on my blog. 

I'm also a big Godot enthusiast and a Destiny nerd. Aside from games, I play bass guitar, practice Kendo (Japanese fencing), and do some occasional photography.
