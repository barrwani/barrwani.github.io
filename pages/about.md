# **NYC-based Gameplay Programmer & Computer Science Student**

<img style="float: left; padding-right:20px" src="/assets/barwani.webp">

I'm a Gameplay Programmer working towards a B.A in Computer Science and Linguistics (+ Game Design minor) at NYU's College of Arts and Sciences. 

Most of my 3D work revolves around 3C's and NPC AI, so I'm familiar with Finite State Machines, character movement customization (Custom Character Movement Component implementation in UE5), 3D Linear Algebra, Locomotion Systems, and Inverse Kinematics (IK). My 2D work, on the other hand, tends to be more generalist and ranges from movement and NPC AI to UI/UX and environment programming.

I'm currently working at NYU's High Performance Computing (HPC) Department under the [High Speed Research Network](https://hsrn.nyu.edu/) (HSRN) team on an open-source networking framework called Corelink. My work so far has involved rewriting documentation, integrating Corelink into Unreal Engine 5, and drafting plans for a Godot Engine client/plugin. 

I'm a big Godot enthusiast, with it being my first game engine. I'm also a huge fan of Destiny/D2, Warframe, Titanfall 2, and Katana Zero. Aside from games, I play bass guitar, practice Kendo (Japanese fencing), and do some occasional photography.

**Languages:** C++, C, Python, GDScript, Java, Shell, Bash, Assembly

**Tools:** Unreal Engine, Godot Engine, Git/GitHub, Docker, Singularity, RHEL (Rocky), SDL2, OpenGL
