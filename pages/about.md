# **NYC-based Gameplay Programmer & Computer Science Student**

<img style="float: left; padding-right:20px" src="/assets/barwani.webp">

I'm a Gameplay Programmer working towards a degree at NYU's College of Arts and Sciences working towards a B.A in Computer Science and Linguistics. 

In 2019 I co-founded an indie game development studio called Nahar Studios: [nahar.dev](https://nahar.dev/). I mainly work as a team lead, gameplay programmer, and game/level designer, communicating with artists, writers, and designers on design, implementation, and cohesion. 

Most of my work revolves around implementing core gameplay systems such as AI and Player 3C (Character, Controls, Camera) systems and general AI behaviour, UX/UI, and general game entity implementations. I also work on general gameplay and workflow systems, such as inheritance and composition structures, state machines, singletons, asset integration, etc.

I'm currently working at NYU's High Performance Computing (HPC) Department under the [High Speed Research Network](https://hsrn.nyu.edu/) (HSRN) team on an open-source networking framework called Corelink. My work so far has involved rewriting documentation, integrating Corelink into Unreal Engine 5, and drafting plans for a Godot Engine client/plugin. 

I'm also a big Godot enthusiast, with it being my first game engine. I'm also a huge Destiny nerd, having played the game since its original launch in 2014. Aside from games, I play bass guitar, practice Kendo (Japanese fencing), and do some occasional photography.
